This project uses an ultrasonic sensor for input and triggering device servo motors and Arduino Uno board as the main controller for the circuitry. Once something is in range of the sensor it will send data to the board stating that something is near or close to it, thus triggering three different pre coded movements.
***
**Hardware:** Arduino, Ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, jumper wires, breadboard, computer, USB type A to B cable
***
Connect the Sources: 
* Connect the 5V pin of the arduino to your assigned positive terminal of the breadboard (+).
* GND pin of the arduino to your assigned negative terminal of the breadboard (-).
* Note: Do not ever connect the sources together as this will short circuit your device.
Connect the Sensor: 
* VCC pin of the ultrasonic sensor to the positive terminal(+) of the breadboard.
* GND pin of the ultrasonic sensor to the negative terminal(-) of the breadboard,
* SIGNAL  pin of the ultrasonic sensor to the pin number 7 of the arduino uno board.
* Note: Use color coding to your wiring in order to avoid confusion.
Connect the Servo motor: 
* positive terminal(red wire) of the servo motor to the voltage source terminal in the breadboard(+).
* negative terminal(black wire) of the servo motor to the ground in the breadboard(-).
* data pin(yellow or white wire) of the servo motor to pin number 9 an 10 of the arduino board.
